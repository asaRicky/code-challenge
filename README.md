# code-challenge
# This is a code challange set to evaluate and analyse what content we have gone thrpough this week.This project consists of three codes that are set to run different programs to produce different values.

# THE STUDENT'S GRADE GENERATOR(Toy problem) - In this code you are expected to write a prompt on inputs on scores such that the only readable scores are between 0 to 100 inorder to analyse the grades of students.The inputted scores should run so as to reach expected output. The expected outputs are grades ranging from `grade A `to` grade E `as follows: `100-80('A')`, `79-60('B')`, `59-50('C')`, `49-40('D')`, `39-0('E')` .

# THE SPEED DETECTOR(Toy problem) - In this code you are expected to write a program that takes an input on the speed of a car to be `80km/hr`, so if the speed is 70km/hr ,it should print `OK`.Otherwise for every 5km/s above the speed limit `(70km/hr)`you get a speeding point. The speeding speeding points keep counting till 12 points.`If exceeded one's License is suspended`.

# THE NET SALARY OPERATOR(Toy problem) - In this code you are expected to write a program whose major task is to calculate and Individual's Net salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.Calculate the  payee (i.e. Tax), `NHIFDeductions`, `NSSFDeductions`, `gross salary`, and `net salary`.

# NB:Use `KRA`, `NHIF` and `NSSF` values provided in the links below;
